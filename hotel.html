                        <p>Known as the "Grand Dame of the East," the Peninsula Hong Kong is the flagship property of Peninsula Hotels. In fact, the hotel's name was inspired by its location at the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula.Since its opening in 1928, the Peninsula has set the standard for luxury in Hong Kong, from its glossy fleet of green Rolls Royce Phantoms to the private jet available for guest use.It's also Hong Kong's oldest hotel and the first to feature pageboys and buffet dining.</p>

                        <p>The Ritz Hotel, built in 1906, was London's first steel structure and the first hotel in the city to have bathrooms in every guest room.Over its 109-year history, patrons have included nobles like King Edward VIII and movie stars like Charlie Chaplin. Of its many claims to fame, however, perhaps the most widely known is its appearance in the 1999 film "Notting Hill," starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.</p>
